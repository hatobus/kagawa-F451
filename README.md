# kagawa-F451

This repository is the joke site.

The Kagawa Prefectural Assembly in Japan has established an ordinance that limits the game and internet to one hour per day.

So this joke service like the twitter shuts out in one hours accessed from kagawa pref users. 
Shuted out user gets the HTTP status code 451. This status code defined by [RFC 7725](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725).
